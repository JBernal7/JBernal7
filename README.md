### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
![IMG_20170923_131902 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100314590/158027930-d2208dee-7789-478b-bb85-9a06168065bc.jpg)

I am a biologist fascinated by geomatics and spatial modeling, with also robust training in law applied to the environment and land use planning. I am interested in macroecological processes, seeking to improve our knowledge in habitat suitability distribution modeling, mainly at the species level, but in conjunction with communities, ecosystems, and their services. Accordingly, I am looking for projects focused on these fundamental strands, as well as on more applied aspects, such as climate and land use changes, biological invasions, or rare and threatened species management.
