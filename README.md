### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
![IMG_20170923_131902 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100314590/158027930-d2208dee-7789-478b-bb85-9a06168065bc.jpg)

I am a graduated biologist specialized in environmental sciences from the University of Malaga and passionate about the GIS world. Long time ago, the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) gave me the opportunity to put into practice the knowledge acquired during my training through two projects, after which it would be the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) that would allow me to know what are the main tools international organizations have and where the world of conservation is heading at different scales. 

The above mentioned experiences led me to the desire to expand my skills in those areas of law and planning that I consider key, so I began and completed with honors a Master's Degree in Territorial, Urban and Environmental Planning at the Faculty of
Law of the University of MÃ¡laga. 

On the other hand, now, after more than 10 years of professional experience in management and as an environmental technician for both the public and private sectors, I continue my learning and research career within the framework of a prestigious Master's Degree in Geomatics, Remote Sensing and Spatial Models. 

ðŸ“« I`m currently working on getting my website ready soon. In the meantime you can reach me on:
